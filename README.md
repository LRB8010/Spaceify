Thank you for visiting my small front-end application.

This is a very simple app that makes a fetch request to NASA's API and then displays the info in cards I built.
I have not worked with front-end in a while since I've started my support engineer role, so this was good refresher. I also implemented a lot of things I had not used before, an example, CSS grids. This simple app was built using vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. Font-awesome was used for the heart shaped icon and the loading wheel. If you downloaded my code from GitHub, you can run the app by simply opening the index.html on your google browser. If you haven't checked out my GitHub, here the link to this project, https://github.com/LRB8010/Spaceify.
And here is the link of the hosted version for you to check out!  http://devbernal.com/Spaceify/

Once again, thank you!
